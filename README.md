# Ising_and_F_models
Performs Monte Carlo simulations on the two-dimensional Ising model and the Rys F model.

The codes implement the Metropolis algorithm for the Ising model and the Cluster-type algorithm for the F model. They were constructed as a part of my undergraduate project at Durham University, titled "Statistical Mechanics: Phase Transitions and Simulations".

The following models are covered:

- 2D Ising model
- 2D F model on a square lattice

Most calculations and functions used in the models are mainly motivated by the book of M. E. J. Newman and G. T. Barkema, "Monte Carlo Methods in Statistical Physics" (1999).
